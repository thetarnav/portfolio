title: Polska w Legendach

# The Goal

Our task was to create three posters, promoting the art competition about Polish historical legends, organized by an educational institution for the 100th anniversary of Poland's national independence day.

From a common dream to its implementation, through tragedy, to glory - our posters, besides focusing on the upcoming event, brought viewers to the rich world of Polish legends.

# From zero to a Hero

Legends place special emphasis on the stories of people whose obsession has become a constant struggle with challenges surrunding them, achieving deserved glory - we also wanted the work to focus on the appeling storeis of heros and their achievements, not limited to a simple interpretation.
