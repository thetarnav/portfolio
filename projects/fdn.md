# The Client

**For Science Foundation**.

A non-governmental organization

# Project Goal

Our task was to create a **fully responsive website**. A digital space, that would showcase the mission, goals, and idea behind the foundation.

# My Contribution

I played my part in this project as a both **UX/UI Designer** and **Web Developer**.

From the beginning, I worked in cooperation to create lo-fi wireframes, visual style, and some of the necessary views and components.

When that key part was completed, I could focus on prototyping more advanced components and later developing the entire website.
